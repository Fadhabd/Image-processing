# Image-processing
Edit digital photos with multiple filters for processing
In the included files, there is a software code with a specific filter to remove the noise of digital images, 
as well as you can insert any saved image that you have only you have to change the extension of the image and this is
a link that contains all the images and the extension.. Good luck
